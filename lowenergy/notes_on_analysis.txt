As a reference, given that the files in the pdbstructures folder that end in the name ".renum" have PDB numbering that matches the output models exactly, the active site rmsd can be easily calculated using something like the following.

# load 2jiecg.pdb 2jienocg.pdb and ../pdbstructures/2jie.pdb.clean.renum into PyMOL

# overlay all 3 structures onto one another (the crystal structure should be the reference)

## get the CA positions that are within 8 A of the hetatms in the reference
sele aroundhetatm, 2gke.pdb.clean.renum and n. CA within 8 of 2gke.pdb.clean.renum and het

# convert that to a list of numbers
myres = []
iterate aroundhet, myres.append(resi)
print "+".join(myres)

#copy those residue into the next section
# listofres = print "+".join(myres)

sel xtal, 2gke.pdb and n.  CA and resi $listofres
sel cg, 2gkecg and n.  CA and resi $listofres
sel nocg, 2gkenocg and n.  CA and resi $listofres

#then calculate the values with
rms_cur xtal, cg
rms_cur xtal, nocg
