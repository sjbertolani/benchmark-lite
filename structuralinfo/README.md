## Structural Info

For each target, this folder contains a file called **$target.templatescatres** 

The first line of this file contains the target pdb code, then is followed by the catalytic residue 1letter code, residue number and optional (default chain A) chain
The subsequent lines are the mappings for each of the target residues to each of the template residues. In some cases, there is no clear mapping and that specific target-template cataltyic residue is ignored
