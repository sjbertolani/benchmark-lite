## Crystal docking


This section contains the files needed to dock the ligands into the crystal structures. This verifies that the enzdes cst files can recover the binding mode of the transition state in the crystal structure.

In fact, this marks the lower bound on the benchmark. We cannot do any better than when we redock straight into the crystal structure.
