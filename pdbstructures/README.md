## pdbstructures 

This folder contains the PDB crystal structures for the targets. The files ending in "clean" are the PDB targets, that have had other chains removed
The files ending in "renum" have been carefully renumbered to exactly match the numbering of the output target models to ease analysis.
These files ending in "renum" can be used to calculate active site, cat res RMSD and other metrics using the modeli numbering.
